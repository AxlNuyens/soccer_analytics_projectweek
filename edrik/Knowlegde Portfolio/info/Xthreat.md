## Expected Threat (xT): Mapping and Valuing Danger on the Football Pitch

**What is it?**

Expected Threat (xT) is a framework in football analytics that quantifies the **increase in the probability of scoring** that a player's action creates. It essentially measures how much more dangerous a team becomes to score after a specific action, particularly passes and carries.

**Core Idea:**

xT is built on the understanding that:

*   **Not all areas of the pitch are equally dangerous.**  Zones closer to the opponent's goal are inherently more threatening.
*   **Actions that move the ball into more dangerous zones are valuable.**  Passes, dribbles, and carries that progress the ball into high-threat areas are considered positive and impactful.
*   **xT values actions based on how they change the ball's position within this "threat landscape" of the pitch.**

**How it Works (Simplified Steps):**

1.  **Pitch Segmentation:** The football pitch is divided into a grid of cells or zones.
2.  **Assigning xT Values to Cells:** Each cell in the grid is assigned an xT value. This value represents the **probability of scoring from that cell within the next few actions within the same possession.** Cells closer to the goal, especially central areas in the penalty box, will have higher xT values (more dangerous). Cells further away from the goal have lower xT values.
3.  **Calculating Action Value:** When a player performs an action (e.g., a pass):
    *   Determine the **starting cell** of the action and its xT value.
    *   Determine the **ending cell** of the action (where the ball arrives) and its xT value.
    *   The **xT value of the action** is the **difference** between the xT value of the *ending cell* and the xT value of the *starting cell*.  A positive xT value means the action increased the threat.

**Why is xT a Valuable Metric?**

*   **Values More Than Just Goals:** xT assesses the value of *all* on-ball actions that contribute to attack, not just shots or final passes. It recognizes the importance of build-up play and ball progression.
*   **Contextual Spatial Analysis:** xT considers *where* on the pitch an action occurs, providing a spatial dimension to performance evaluation beyond simple event counts.
*   **Quantifies Threat Creation Objectively:**  It provides a numerical measure of how effectively players and teams generate attacking threat and progress the ball into dangerous positions.
*   **Player Performance Assessment:** xT can be used to evaluate players based on their ability to consistently increase their team's attacking threat through their actions.
*   **Tactical Insights:** xT analysis can reveal which areas of the pitch a team attacks effectively, identify key players in ball progression, and highlight defensive vulnerabilities in high-threat zones.
*   **Visualizations for Impact:** xT values are ideal for creating impactful visualizations like heatmaps of threat zones and action maps colored by xT contribution.

**xT and Our Project/Libraries:**

*   **`socceraction` Implementation:** The `socceraction` Python library we're using includes a ready-to-use implementation of the Expected Threat (xT) framework.  This makes it straightforward to calculate xT values for actions in our SPADL data.
*   **Visualization Potential:** xT data is perfect for creating compelling visualizations using tools like `mplsoccer` and `d3-soccer`:
    *   **xT Heatmaps:** Visualize the "danger zones" on the pitch.
    *   **xT-Colored Action Maps:** Highlight passes and carries based on their threat contribution.
    *   **Player xT Contribution Charts:**  Showcase individual player's threat creation.

**Relevance for OHL:**

For OHL, xT analysis can provide actionable insights into:

*   **Offensive Strategy:** Identify if OHL effectively moves the ball into high-xT zones and if their attacking patterns maximize threat creation.
*   **Player Strengths:** Pinpoint players who excel at making passes and carries that significantly increase attacking threat.
*   **Defensive Analysis:**  Assess if opponents are able to easily progress into high-xT areas against OHL and identify defensive weaknesses.
*   **Tactical Refinement:**  Inform tactical adjustments to better target high-threat zones in attack and defend them more effectively.

**In Summary:**

Expected Threat (xT) is a powerful and insightful metric that allows us to objectively measure and visualize attacking danger in football. By valuing space and the movement of the ball into threatening locations, xT offers a deeper understanding of attacking play and provides valuable insights for player and team performance analysis.
